1. The parent class is Spell. The child classes are Accio and Confundo.

2. 1. The base class is Spell. The sub-classes are Accio and Confundo.

3. The output:

Summoning Charm
Accio Summoning Charm
No description
Confundo Confundus Charm
Causes the victim to become confused and befuddled.

(I checked by running it and name and incantation are switched as parameters of the parent class. I kept my original answer)

4. When study_spell(Confundo()) executes, Confundo's subclass method gets executed because any method that a subclass has with the same name overrides the parent method. However, the parent method does not get affected.

5. I assume this question is asking to update the description. Add this method to the Accio subclass.

def get_description(self):
    return 'This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance'
